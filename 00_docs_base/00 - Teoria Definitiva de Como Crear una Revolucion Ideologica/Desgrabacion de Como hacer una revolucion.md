NARRATOR: “Now let’s visit a free commune,


[0:00 - 1:05] It feels like everything is falling apart.
The planet is simultaneously flooded and on fire, wars are raging, prices are hiking,
and fascism is rising.
We live in an age of crisis as capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, patriarchy, and
the state aim to retain their stranglehold on our world.
My generation faces a future of profound uncertainty, as the basic means of subsistence—especially
food and shelter—are becoming increasingly inaccessible to the vast majority of us.
Movements of various political flavours have arisen in response to these conditions, but
the machine seems to continue unperturbed.
For those of us who haven’t completely given up on the fate of the world, we’re looking
for ways to change our trajectory.
We want to know what we can do to help.
Our situation calls for real change.
It calls for more than just resistance.
It calls for revolution.
Social revolution: what anarchists propose for a complete transformation of our society,

[1:05 - 2:12] economy, culture, philosophy, technology, relationships, and politics.
Of course, that would be illegal, so while our situation may call for it, I cannot.
As we all know, legality is what determines morality.
However, if we’re operating in the world of fiction, we can explore the practical components
of social revolution.
If our characters are facing apocalyptic collapse in their lifetimes and they’re seeking real
change, the answer is social revolution.
Now, people have a habit of conflating revolution with insurrection or coup d'etats.
A lot of works of fiction make this mistake, seemingly drawing from the flashy imagery
of the Storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution, and that has become the
image of revolution in popular culture.
A final climactic showdown between the masses and the footsoldiers of empire.
The smell of smoke and gunpowder in the air.
The roar of a bloodthirsty crowd.
The burning sensation of tear gas overcoming one's senses.
Eventually, success comes with the replacement of one set of rulers with another.

[2:12 - 3:22] A lot of modern day wannabe socialist and even anarchist revolutionaries still hold
to this misconception of what a revolution entails.
The way they talk about revolution as some distant future event with a clear before and
after betrays that kind of mentality.
It’s practically millenarian, as though they’re waiting for the Second Coming of
Karl Marx to bestow the capital-R Revolution upon the masses.
But if you’re trying to write a realistic anarchist social revolution in a fictional
modern day setting, then as Alexander Berkman put it, you need a revolution “that seeks
to alter the whole character of society.”
In case you didn’t know, anarchism is a political philosophy and movement based in
opposition to all forms of hierarchical control and promotion of a society within which individuals
can freely cooperate together as equals.
The social revolution that anarchists seek requires people transforming society and transforming
themselves in the process.
It is not a sudden flipping of the switch, but a gradual change in people’s powers,
drives, and consciousness.

[3:22 - 4:46] Social revolution is an ongoing process, not a singular event.
Social revolution is heterogenous and dynamic, not religiously uniform.
It may be punctuated by major ruptures and advances, but it requires a range of tactics
informed by a variety of strategies built upon an array of short-term and long-term
goals.
It starts here and now, developing people’s nascent anarchic tendencies.
A social revolution takes years of social struggle breaking down all forms of oppression
and creating new ways of living.
In a phrase, a social revolution requires revolutionaries that both oppose and propose.
This is a hopefully comprehensive guide to what that looks like.
[TITLE CARD] At the most basic level, a social revolution
requires the cooperation of multiple people.
One potential form that cooperation can take is the affinity group.
Affinity groups are small groups of anarchists who work together to spread anarchic ideas
to the wider culture.
Their work requires a combination of actions that both oppose and propose, particularly

[4:46 - 6:05] in the realm of education, where affinity groups must simultaneously expand people’s
consciousness of systems of oppression and demonstrate the possibilities of alternatives.
Additionally, affinity groups seek to develop the anarchic powers and capacities of people
in mass movements, unions, and communities to engage in direct action and learn to manage
their own affairs without hierarchy.
Affinity groups may host workshops and skillshares where they can disseminate skills and build
connections in their communities.
Within affinity groups, folks can fill different roles developing agitprop, which is the intentional
promotion of ideas through literature, music, poetry, theatre, film, illustration, social
media, and other forms of political art.
Don’t underestimate the potential ripple effects a small network of affinity groups
can have on the broader zeitgeist.
Political action to oppose can generally be divided further into two major groups: acts
of confrontation, which require less people but involve more risk, and acts of noncooperation,
which require more people but involve slightly less risk due to safety in numbers.
Technically speaking, acts of noncooperation could fall under acts of confrontation and

[6:05 - 7:07] vice versa, but doh get tie up.
They’re imperfect categories.
Let’s begin with acts of confrontation.
Protests are a very public form of sometimes indirect, sometimes direct political action
that anarchists may utilise in order to raise awareness and keep the spirit of revolt alive
and well.
Protest, when executed correctly, is a sign that people are thinking and acting for themselves
and against what authorities want them to do.
However, protesting is very risky.
Even nonviolent protests can be subject to severe, violent retribution, either from counter-protestors
or from the agents of the state.
Organisers have been assassinated, gone missing, or been imprisoned.
Plus protests don’t usually have much control over their messaging, making them vulnerable
to the highly developed propaganda machine of corporate media.
Alternative media organised by affinity groups can help spread the truth about protests,
but they can't always compete.

[7:07 - 8:20] Still, political protest in the context of a broader social revolution is both powerful
and necessary to resist oppression.
Keep in mind that anarchists’ engagement with protests is not based on a desire to
lobby those in power for change.
The lobbying approach typically results in a highly hierarchical and disempowered movement,
where the masses below do the work and take on the risk, while an elite minority of activists
rub shoulders with politicians and lose touch with the cause.
Lobbying requires compromise, while anarchists recognise that the unyielding persistence
of a radical movement can produce reforms without ever limiting themselves to reforms.
The Zapatistas were able to gain and maintain the land they now hold because a government,
even a “progressive” government, does not give away some of its power unless it
is scared of losing all of its power.
Rather than expending time, resources, and energy trying to convince or change a government,
movements can focus on building up a real threat that can drive a hard bargain through
direct forms of action.
Direct action means working to accomplish goals directly rather than relying on authorities

[8:20 - 9:33] or representatives as intercessors.
But crucially, direct action requires a security culture capable of protecting its perpetrators
from the law.
Again, I’m not advocating for anything illegal, just describing how an anarchist social revolution
works.
A security culture is an instinctive set of customs developed and shared by a community
whose members may be targeted by the government, designed to minimize risk.
The central principle of security culture is that people should never be privy to any
sensitive information they do not need to know.
Don’t ask, don’t tell.
Don’t make it easy for your enemies, don’t let paranoia overrun your movements, and don’t
put yourself or others at unnecessary risk.
Alongside support networks that can lend transporation and safehousing for those involved, much like
the underground railroad, having a solid security culture is necessary for the usually very
illegal actions that seek to directly confront and dismantle institutions of power.
Obstruction refers to any actions that movements may engage in that seek to delay or cease

[9:33 - 10:56] the operations of those in power by making it physically impossible for them to proceed
with their intended actions.
Using sheer numbers or shrewd strategies, this can range from a DDoS attack to highway
blockades to eviction resistance to the disruption of mining, logging, construction, or drilling
activities that are damaging the environment and endangering poor communities.
Another usually temporary tactic is occupation, where a collective may squat and hold critical
infrastructure such as factories, transportation systems, school buildings, shopping centers,
public squares, parks, and empty land or housing in order to force change and construct counter-spaces
where protestors may reimagine and transform infrastructure in a way that is conducive
to public need rather than state or corporate interest.
If sustained and defended, occupation can eventually lead to reclamation, such as when
the workers occupations in Argentina during the 2001 economic crisis led to the creation
of self-managed cooperatives.
The Reclaim The Streets movement is another example of reclamation, where communities
have “invaded” roads or highways to stage a party with free food and music, opening
up the space we have lost to car-centric infrastructure.

[10:56 - 12:15] Land and housing can be secured, cooperatives can be developed, streets can be pedestrianised,
and the commons can be reclaimed through sustained and defended occupation.
Expropriation is another example of direct action in the style of Robin Hood, “liberating”
food, medicine, money, supplies, or equipment from the rich and distributing them to the
people.
Historically, many affinity groups have engaged in bank robberies and other forms of theft
in order to finance their revolutionary activities, propaganda, and bails from prison.
New Afrikan anarchist Kuwasi Balagoon was imprisoned for an attempted bank robbery in
order to fund Black Liberation Army activities and Lucio Urtubia was a Spanish anarchist
known for his practice of expropriative anarchism.
However, sometimes revolutionaries seek sabotage and destruction instead of expropriation.
Whether merely threatened or actually carried out, destruction of property during riots
or other political activities has a long and proud history of success.
From individual acts of sabotage during slavery to MK guerillas’ bombings of the communications,
transit, and energy infrastructure that helped run the South African Apartheid economy to
Indigenous activists in Canada sabotaging efforts to start fracking near their land.

[12:15 - 13:24] Lastly, there are acts of confrontation that involve violence against humans, which I must
repeat that I do not support.
This violence can be either offensive or defensive, organised by militias or undertaken by individuals,
but ultimately it aims to make being a rapist, a fascist, an officer, a capitalist, or a
politician a very dangerous position to be in.
In a society where the power-hungry already rule, during the process of social revolution,
people will gain their freedom by overthrowing every existing and would-be authority and
defending against those who seek to re-impose that authority through self-managed forms
of self-defence, because the freedom anarchists seek does not include the freedom to oppress
others.
Organised militias will be necessary to defend revolutionary gains.
[SKIT 1] NARRATOR: Meanwhile, in someone’s backyard…
Antoine: “We’ve done it, they’re all dead, finally we’ve freed ourselves from
the tyranny of the grasshoppers!
Workers of the anthill unite, we have nothing to lose but our chains!”
Antony: “They can exploit our labour no longer!

[13:24 - 14:27] Now we can build a better anthill, without being bossed around by anybody!”
Lenant: “Yes, let’s build a better anthill.
You over there, start gathering fruits for the stockpiles, and you two, bring that dead
beetle we found a few days ago.”
Antony: “But wait, but who died and made you the boss, Lenant?
I thought we were gonna run this anthill horizontally, the way we promised.”
Lenant: “I’m no boss, comrade!
I’m a worker ant just like you.
But you see, even though the dictatorship of the grasshoppers may be over, we still
need a dictatorship of the worker ants in the transition to create ant communism.
You should read State and Revolutiant.
Don’t worry, all ants are equal.
Eventually I, I mean we, won’t be worker ants anymore.”
Antony: “Uh, but I think we should-” Lenant: “What are you, some kind of counter-revolutionary?
Do you want the grasshoppers to come back?
Stop wasting time, go and gather food for the glorious people’s anthill!”

[14:27 - 15:32] Narrator: A few months later, at the People’s Anthill…”
Antoine: “Can you give me a leg?
I’m carrying food to Chairant Lenant.
I hope I made quota this week!”
Antony: “Sure comrade, but, shouldn’t we be free by now?
It feels like the grasshoppers are in charge all over again here.”
Ant 1: “Comrade, don’t you remember what Lenant said?
All ants are equal, but some ants are more equal than others.”
Ant 2: “*sigh* Maybe we should have prefigured something differ-ant.”
On the other side of the “oppose” coin are acts of noncooperation, either political,
social, or economic.
Like I said before, these could also be considered acts of confrontation, but again, they’re
just categories, however imperfect.
Strikes are perhaps one of the most well-recognised forms of revolutionary noncooperative political
action, but people underestimate exactly how powerful and multifaceted a strike can be.
There are different types of strikes that encompass different segments of the population

[15:32 - 16:42] and target different segments of the system.
Labour strikes are a mass refusal of workers to work.
Labour strikes can occur in a specific workplace, a specific industry, or in the case of a general
strike, across multiple industries.
Strikes can be organised and called for by unions or they can be organised without the
approval of unions and with significantly more risk, as with wildcat strikes.
For anarchists, wildcat strikes are necessary to circumvent the capitulatory and bureaucratic
nature of some unions, as very few unions these days are actually revolutionary, and,
due to the rise of the high-turnover, atomised jobs of the service economy, very few workers
are unionised.
Strikes are born from the recognition that capitalists need labour, not the other way
around.
Particularly for movements with radical aims, a well-defended and well-supported general
strike can play a powerful role in the rupture of the capitalist state of affairs and reclamation
of the means of production.
However, it isn’t easy to achieve a general strike.

[16:42 - 18:00] Alki made an excellent video on the topic, but in short, a general strike needs support
from a mass grassroots coalition of radical political, social, and labour organisations.
It won’t be achieved via Reddit..
Student strikes bring together affinity groups within educational institutions and mobilise
specific classes or entire student bodies to protest issues in politics and academics,
without waiting to be legitimised by the channels of authority.
Students can use their campus as a space to meet, study material conditions, and create
spaces to strengthen the autonomy of students to direct their own education and develop
a kaleidoscope of academic possibilities.
Rent strikes are a method of resistance tenants can use against landlords where they collectively
refuse to pay rent.
They can operate as part of an effort to occupy and reclaim housing or they can just push
particular demands such as better conditions or lowered rents.
A rent strike needs three basic elements in order to succeed: shared dissatisfaction among
tenants, outreach to build numbers and therefore the threat of the strike, and finally, support,
both legal support and physical support against evictions.

[18:00 - 19:18] Taxpayer strikes, or organised tax resistance, refers to a collective refusal to pay tax.
Governments have always struggled with tax noncompliance and the tactic has been used
effectively to supplement protests against wars or, in the case of the Indian independence
movement, against the colonial state.
Debt strikes are a method of collective debt resistance that aims to breakdown current
debt dogma and free people and communities from the stranglehold of debt.
Organisations such Strike Debt purchase and forgive monetary debt through the Rolling
Jubilee program and organise debt strikes where debtors defer their loan payments as
a method of mass financial civil disobedience.
On the consumer side of things, boycotts are a popular form of collective action and passive
resistance.
Though not as effective as they used to be, due to the multinational and conglomerate
nature of today’s capitalism, on a targeted small-scale or a well-coordinated large scale,
if organised into mass movements and undertaken in coordination with sympathetic strikes,
consumer boycotts can have some impact in the social revolutionary struggle.
Then again, boycotts don’t have to be limited to boycotts against businesses.

[19:18 - 20:37] Leveraging numbers to apply social sanctions can force change in other settings.
Other acts of noncooperation may also include conscientious objection for draftees, mutiny
and insubordination for soldiers and other government workers, and social pressure through
shunning of class traitors, scabs, racists, sexists, and others who act to uphold oppressive
systems.
Between the acts of confrontation and acts of noncooperation I’ve just outlined, I
believe that pretty much exhausts the “oppose” side of the expression.
Now we can turn to the side of social revolution that undertakes political action to propose
and build alternatives.
Today is the shadow of tomorrow Today is the present future of yesterday
Yesterday is the shadow of today The darkness of the past is yesterday
And the light of the past is yesterday This is the aim of prefigurative politics,
which is the deliberate experimental implementation of desired future social relations, institutions,
infrastructure, and practices in the here-and-now.
The anarchist argument for social revolution is not that political means and ends should
be linked in important ways, but that they already are.

[20:37 - 21:49] Today is the preview of tomorrow.
Thus, it is vital that organisational practices prefigure liberatory and not authoritarian
forms.
That means developing people’s powers, drives, and consciousness in a way that is conducive
to anarchic social change.
Powers refes to people’s capacity to do or be.
Both individual and collective powers are determined by the natural, historical, and
especially social contexts folks find themselves in.
Therefore, movements must be structured in a way that helps members develop the powers
needed to organise horizontally and spread this form of organisation to others.
There is a strong connection between powers to develop and appreciate free and equal social
relations and the drives to establish and enhance them, because drives are also shaped
by social contexts.
Lastly, consciousness enables people to contemplate and alter their activity as needed.
Radical education helps people to develop forms of consciousness which enable them to
better understand, assess, orient themselves in, and change their society.

[21:49 - 23:03] Now let’s talk prefigurative politics.
Mutual aid must be a foundational concept in any social revolutionary project.
Put simply, mutual aid is a form of political participation in which people take responsibility
for caring for one another and changing political conditions by building relationships, networks
of reciprocity, and communal autonomy from the state.
Mutual aid may involve work to support people impacted by harmful systems and work to create
alternative infrastructure.
It can take the form of ride sharing, disaster response, food distribution, and much more,
as you’ll soon see.
However, those engaging in mutual aid must ask themselves if their actions are providing
material relief, avoiding legitimising oppressive systems, mobilising people for ongoing struggle,
and accomodating marginalised groups.
Mutual aid is not meant to be charity.
It must actively cultivate liberatory skills, practices, and solidarity.
In Anarchism and the Black Revolution, Black anarchist and former Panther Lorenzo Kom’boa
Ervin wrote about the need to create survival programmes to feed, house, and serve poor

[23:03 - 24:13] and working people facing life-altering conditions.
Survival programmes are based in a specific geographical region, where members of a community
get together to meet specific needs in their area, with the aim of building connections,
consciousness, and eventually popular assemblies.
A popular assembly is a free association of members of a community gathered with the aim
of self-management.
Popular assemblies allow community problems and improvements to be identified and solved
directly, drawing upon the ideas and experiences of everyone and enriched by discussion and
debate.
Decisions may be made via consensus or through other forms of decision making, such as liquid
democracy, majority vote, or supermajority vote.
Within a popular assembly, affinity groups may form to advocate their specific interests
in an coordinated manner.
The town of Cherán in Mexico provides just one example of successful community control,
where the community armed themselves, kicked out the police, the cartels, and the local
government, and organised popular assemblies to manage their own affairs.

[24:13 - 25:34] Popular assemblies will need to network and confederate with other popular assemblies
and revolutionary organisations in order to build their collective power and autonomy.
For example, communities will need to develop their capacity to feed themselves.
Urban agriculture might be able to supplement dietary needs, but ultimately, community-supported
agriculture provides a more robust alternative in the long term.
Community-supported agriculture or cropsharing is a system that connects producers and consumers
within the food system without a middle-man by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the
harvest of a certain farm or group of farms.
For the purpose of revolution, cropsharing can connect farming cooperatives with popular
assemblies to develop an alternative economy.
A cooperative is simply an autonomous association of people united to meet their common economic,
social, and/or cultural needs and aspirations through a collectively-owned and democratically-controlled
organisation.
Cohousing cooperatives deal with housing, workers cooperatives deal with various industries
including food, healthcare, transportation, construction, and clothing, credit unions
deal with finance, including potentially financing revolutionary projects, platform cooperatives

[25:34 - 26:52] deal with websites or apps, and utility cooperatives deal with the provision of utilities in a
community or region.
Makerspaces, codingspaces, and cooperative labs can create room for research and innovation
in revolutionary projects, bringing together people of a diverse set of skills to collaborate
and find solutions to the issues raised by the broader community.
As I discussed in my videos on the library economy and the commons, the reclamation of
the commons is absolutely vital to revolution.
In brief, the commons refers to any collectively managed natural or man-made resource system,
such as a community land trust, a local forest, a shared pasture, or a renewable energy system.
Revolutionaries can engage in building full-fledged library economies based on the commons.
This can take the form of tool libraries, vehicle libraries, clothing libraries, furniture
libraries, and more in an effort curb overproduction, end planned obsolescence, and provide access
to an irreducible minimum to all.
Revolutionaries can also establish childcare collectives and free schools.
Free schools are autonomous, non-hierarchical spaces intended for educational exchange and
skillsharing.

[26:52 - 28:10] They reject the subordination of students to teachers and organise classes in a way
that promotes critical consciousness across a variety of subjects.
From nursery through college, in community centers, parks, libraries, and other shared
spaces, learners and facilitators can collaborate to develop and self-manage an autonomous education
system that can dispense knowledge and skills among the community.
Free children beget a free society, and education should facilitate their freedom.
Communities must also develop methods of conflict resolution and new systems of justice.
Mistakes and disagreements are inevitable, so there must be some means in place for discussing,
deciding, and resolving conflict and incidents within and between communities, cooperatives,
and individuals in a healthy and effective way, such as through arbitration, mediation,
or conciliation.
Community defence against domination and abuses of power requires a system of justice capable
of responding to harmful behaviour.
How that manifests is subject to much debate among anarchists and abolitionists, so I will
reserve that discussion for a future video.
[SKIT 2] NARRATOR: “Now let’s visit a free commune,

[28:10 - 29:14] A radical few who chose to maroon They wished to abolish capitalism and more
But they left the city and its working class core
Utopia was the goal, but they couldn’t be accessed
Solidarity made impossible between the commune and the oppressed
When the time drew near and their comrades would call
The commune folk didn’t help, at all” (phone rings)
G: “Hey T, it’s me again, we’re down here, city hall, downtown, we’re striking
and we could really use some of your aid, just like old times.”
T: “Wassup comrade G, you know we’d love to help but the rains just came down last
week and we’ve been trying to fix our place.
Plus we’re setting up a new irrigation system, just tryna get it up and running, so we just
don’t have the time to make it downtown this time.
But I promise you man, we’ll be sure to help out next time.”
G: “*Sigh* Okay T, but you know this is the third time this happened.
What happened to solidarity forever?”
T: “Yo, of course, man, of course, solidarity forever.

[29:14 - 30:19] But we’re just too busy, you know?
Don’t worry, we always got love for you, we’ll support the movement when things settle
down for us here at the commune, but for now we just, we have our own fires to put out.”
NARRATOR: “But year after year, there was always a cause
Why the commune folk couldn’t partake in class wars
They shrunk to the background, doing their own thing
Until the phone of revolution, no longer did ring
A year or two down the line, money got tight With no allies or comrades, new ambitions
were in sight.”
T: “I think we should start a farmer’s market”
NARRATOR: “Before long, these radicals took another tacit turn
A bed and breakfast was born, with the money they’d earn
Book a stay, one and all, at the Breadbook B&B
You pay for your room, the utopia’s free They once were merry, they once were gay
But they forgot to oppose and they lost their way.”
Oppose and propose.

[30:19 - 31:35] Propose and oppose.
Confrontation, noncooperation, and prefiguration.
A variety of organisations and individuals undertaking a variety of roles, tactics, and
strategies in a variety of settings in concert to develop the revolution.
Supporters unable to directly engage helping fund the projects of these movements.
Ultimately, the social revolution is a movement from below, by and for the oppressed to achieve
their own freedom.
It is an ongoing process to make society more diverse, open, and free.
Expanding pockets of social change around the world until new examples of what life
could be are made known to all.
Remember that even in struggle, it’s not just serious business.
Revolution can and should be fun—a carnival of the oppressed.
It’s about making life worth living.
It’s about emancipating people.
As Emma Goldman said, “If I can’t dance, it’s not my revolution.”
Remember that “It always seems impossible until it’s done.”

[31:35 - 32:37] All power to all the people.
Peace.
[SKIT 3] “I haven't felt this good in a really long
time.
These days, me and some friends of mine have been really working hard on trying to get
some new irrigation systems in place in the community commons so that we can really grow
our own food year round.
It's good to have, you know, the farming cooperatives working with us across the region, but we
also want to make sure we have built our resilience locally as well, and we've really restored
the versatility and complexity of our local ecology.
Our cities have gotten more walkable, our grasses look so much greener, probably because
they've been so interwoven with a diversity of native flora.
And it's just been a treasure to breathe air and bask in the atmosphere of the city.
Look at how far we've come!"
"Man, I hear that.
Who would have thought that a little bit of pressure from a couple well-timed strikes,

[32:37 - 34:05] a little elbow grease from people that cared enough, would have us going from clocking
9-5s to running workplaces by us and for us?
Now we have access to the commons, where we can spend more time doing the things we love
with the people we love.
Honestly, it's great."
"All that's cool and all guys, but personally I don't think the struggle's over.
There are still systems of power that we need to look into.
We still don't listen to women as much as we should, we still don't cater to the disabled
as much as we should.
There are social intricacies that we have to unpack in order to truly move forward and
have a better tomorrow."
"I agree, I mean we made it so far already.
We revolutionized our education, our economy, our ecology, our society as a whole.
The way we engage in politics is so fundamentally different.
And yet, there's still work to be done, there's still systems that will take probably generations
to uproot.

[34:05 - 34:39] And yet, I feel like we going in an positive direction, you know what I mean?"
"We're going to get there."
"When you say it like that, I have hope."
"Hope for the future like never before."
