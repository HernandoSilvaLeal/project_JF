**Resumen profesional (breve):**

Article II
We affirm that the Scriptures are the supreme written norm by which God binds the
conscience, and that the authority of the Church is subordinate to that of Scripture.

Article VI
We affirm that the whole of Scripture and all its parts, down to the very words of the
original, were given by divine inspiration.

We deny that the inspiration of Scripture can rightly be affirmed of the whole without the
parts, or of some parts but not the whole.

The origin of Scripture is divine.

We further affirm that copies and translations of Scripture are the
Word of God to the extent that they faithfully represent the original.

We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the
autographs.

Article XIV
We affirm the unity and internal consistency of Scripture.

Article XV
We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy is grounded in the teaching of the Bible about
inspiration.

Article XVII
We affirm that the Holy Spirit bears witness to the Scriptures, assuring believers of the
truthfulness of God's written Word.

Article XIX
We affirm that a confession of the full authority, infallibility, and inerrancy of Scripture
is vital to a sound understanding of the whole of the Christian faith.
