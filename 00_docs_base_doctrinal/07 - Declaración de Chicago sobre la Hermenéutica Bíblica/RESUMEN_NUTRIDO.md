Article II
We affirm that the Scriptures are the supreme written norm by which God binds the
conscience, and that the authority of the Church is subordinate to that of Scripture.

The origin of Scripture is divine.

We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the
autographs.

Article XV
We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy is grounded in the teaching of the Bible about
inspiration.

## Resumen detallado

Recognition of the total truth and
trustworthiness of Holy Scripture is essential to a full grasp and adequate confession of
its authority.

We are persuaded that to deny it is to
set aside the witness of Jesus Christ and of the Holy Spirit and to refuse that submission
to the claims of God's own Word which marks true Christian faith.

ARTICLES OF AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL
Article I
We affirm that the Holy Scriptures are to be received as the authoritative Word of God.

Article II
We affirm that the Scriptures are the supreme written norm by which God binds the
conscience, and that the authority of the Church is subordinate to that of Scripture.

Article VI
We affirm that the whole of Scripture and all its parts, down to the very words of the
original, were given by divine inspiration.

We deny that the inspiration of Scripture can rightly be affirmed of the whole without the
parts, or of some parts but not the whole.

The origin of Scripture is divine.

We further affirm that copies and translations of Scripture are the
Word of God to the extent that they faithfully represent the original.

We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the
autographs.

Article XIV
We affirm the unity and internal consistency of Scripture.

Article XV
We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy is grounded in the teaching of the Bible about
inspiration.

Article XVI
We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy has been integral to the Church's faith
throughout its history.

Article XVII
We affirm that the Holy Spirit bears witness to the Scriptures, assuring believers of the
truthfulness of God's written Word.

We deny that this witness of the Holy Spirit operates in isolation from or against
Scripture.

Article XIX
We affirm that a confession of the full authority, infallibility, and inerrancy of Scripture
is vital to a sound understanding of the whole of the Christian faith.

We further affirm
that such confession should lead to increasing conformity to the image of Christ.
